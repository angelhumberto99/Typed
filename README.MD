# Typing
This project is a complete remake of my very first web application, which was created to help people to use their ten fingers in order to write words more precise and faster using a computer keyboard.

You can test how fast and precise you are, by visiting: https://angelhumberto99.github.io/Typed/

In the header we can customize our experience by changing some of the next settings:
- **Keyboard Layout:** It offers ISO and ANSI layouts in different languages.
- **Keyboard sound:** Emits sounds of key strokes when is active.

In here we can find data about our performance, like the following: 
- **Acuracy:** Checks how many correct words do we achieve from all we typed.
- **WPM:** Calculates how many words per minute do we achieve on our current attempt.
- **Correct:** Says the number of correct words we typed.
- **Incorrect:** Says the number of incorrect words we typed.
- **Personal Best:** Shows the WPMs achieved in our best attempt.
